# BetterStaticLights
Beat Saber mod that lets you choose which lights you want active when "Static Lights" is on.

## Dependencies:
- BSIPA v4.1.6+
- BeatSaberMarkupLanguage v1.5.3+

## Config Options:

**_Set Name_** | Description
-- | --
**_BackTop_** | Contrary to its name, these are going to be your bottom or top sets of lights
**_RingLights_** | Track Ring Lights
**_LeftLasers_** | Left Laser Set
**_RightLasers_** | Right Laser Set
**_BottomBackSide_** | These are going to be your arrow/logo/focal point lasers, as well as the ones **on or near** the track
**_Off_** | Turns off a set of lights

## Roadpath:
- Add support for up to all 5 lighting events to be active.
- Allow for choosing which color you want it to be (according to your Saber ColorScheme).
- Clean and optimize the code (this is literally just a skeleton in it's current phase).
